## NOTICE: Code Moved ! ##

The structWSF source code is now hosted at [GitHub](https://github.com/structureddynamics/structWSF-Open-Semantic-Framework). [GitHub](https://github.com/structureddynamics/structWSF-Open-Semantic-Framework) hosting is based on [Git](http://git-scm.com/), unlike Google Code's Subversion-based service.

Git works a little differently. But, if you have done an SVN checkout in the past, you won't have any problem with git clone.
## Getting the Code ##

The structWSF code is hosted at https://github.com/structureddynamics/structWSF-Open-Semantic-Framework. If you want to get the most recent source code please run git clone ```
git://github.com/structureddynamics/structWSF-Open-Semantic-Framework.git```
