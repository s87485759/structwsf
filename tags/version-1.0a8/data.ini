; structWSF Data Configuration File
;
; All the settings defined in this configuration file are related to the data
; archived in different datastores of a structWSF instance. We split the
; structWSF configuration files in two: one for the settings related to
; the data (this file), and one for the settings related to the network
; that runs the structWSF instance.
;
; This decision has been taken to helps syste administrators spliting the concerns
; between managing the data of a structWSF instance, and its software. Think 
; about an Amazon EC2/EBS setting where the dabases of the structWSF datastores
; are hosted on a EBS volume that can be attached to different running EC2 
; instances.
