== Global structWSF Statistics ==

If you want to participate to the Global structWSF Statistics, you only have to subscribe your structWSF network
at this address:

  http://openstructs.org/structwsf/stats/subscribe
               
You only have to put the URL where this script can be queried, and your stats will be automatically
aggregated with stats of other structWSF networks.
               
If you want to use that script for any reason, you have to set the value of the 
$enableStatisticsBroadcast variable to TRUE in the file statisticsBroker.php
